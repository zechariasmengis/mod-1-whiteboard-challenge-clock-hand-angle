* Given a `String` representing the time on a digital clock (e.g., "12:25", "3:27"), write a method to determine the angle between the hands of an analog clock.

Hint: How many degrees does the hour hand move in an hour? How many degrees does the minute hand move in an hour?
Assume that **both** the hour and the minute hands move **every minute** by the appropriate amount.

Note: For measuring these angles, start at the hour hand and measure clockwise to determine the angle. (ex: "3:00" == 90 degrees but "9:00" == 270 degrees)
